Objective: I need to integrate the "Fairness Engine" feature. This algorithm calculates fair financial contribution ratios by valuing "invisible labor" (unpaid work like childcare) alongside monetary income.

Please implement the following changes:

1. New Component: FairnessCalculatorModal
Create a modal or slide-over component triggered from the Family tab.

Inputs: Create a form for each partner (Alex & Sam) with fields for:

Gross Annual Income (e.g., £45,000).

Unpaid Labour Hours/Week (e.g., 30 hours).

Hourly Value (Default to £15.00).

The Logic:

Calculate "Virtual Income" = Unpaid Hours * Hourly Value * 52.

Calculate "Total Economic Contribution" = Gross Income + Virtual Income.

Derive the Fairness Ratio (percentage split of the Total Economic Contribution).

Visualization:

Display a "Before" bar chart (Income-only split, e.g., 42/58).

Display an "After" bar chart (Fairness split, e.g., 48/52).

Add a text summary: "By recognizing Alex's 30 hours of unpaid labor, the fair contribution shifts by 6%."

Action: Add a "Save Fairness Agreement" button that updates the global app state.

2. UI Integration (Update Existing Screens)
A. Update "Family" Tab [Reference: Family Members Screen]:

Below the "Active Members" list, add a new card titled "Fairness & Contribution".

Display the current ratio (e.g., "Agreed Split: 50/50" or "48/52").

Add a primary button: "Adjust Fairness Settings" (This opens the new Modal).

B. Update "Dashboard" [Reference: Family Dashboard Screen]:

In the top metrics row (next to "Monthly Net Flow" or "Active Goals"), add a new mini-widget: "Fairness Tracker".

It should show if the couple's actual contributions this month match their "Fairness Ratio" (e.g., "On Track" or "Needs Adjustment").

C. Update "Coaching" [Reference: Financial Coach Screen]:

Inject the calculated "Fairness Ratio" into the AI context.

If the ratio is set, the Coach's opening message should acknowledge it: "I'm tracking your goal progress based on your agreed 48/52 fairness split."

3. Data Model Update
Update the FamilyMember state object to include:

income: number

unpaidHours: number

contributionRatio: number (The calculated result).

Style Guide:

Match the existing "Clean, modern, accessible" aesthetic seen in the screenshots.

Use the existing color palette (Deep Blue #0A2540 for headers/buttons, White backgrounds, Light Gray cards).
